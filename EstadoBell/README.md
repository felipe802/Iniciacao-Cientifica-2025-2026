# Bell State Implementation (Qiskit)

This folder contains the source code for generating a Bell State using Qiskit. This is an expository repository for my undergraduate research (IC).

## The Code
The main implementation can be found in `PrimeiroEstadoBell.py`. It constructs a quantum circuit with two qubits, applying a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate.

## Circuit Diagram
Below is the quantum circuit generated by the code:

## Execution Results
These are the results obtained from running the circuit on a local simulator (`qasm_simulator`) with 1024 shots:

## Documentation & Theory
For a deep theoretical explanation of the quantum mechanics behind this state, please refer to the official IC report mentioned in the main repository.
